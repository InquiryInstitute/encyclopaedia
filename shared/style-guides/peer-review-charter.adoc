== Purpose

Peer review at The Encyclopædia differs from traditional academic review. Our reviews are _visible_, appearing as marginalia rather than hidden reports. This makes inquiry public and keeps the canon calm.

== Guiding Principles

=== Visibility

All review outputs become part of the published text:
* Reviews are signed, dated, and attributed
* Readers see the scholarly conversation, not just its result
* Authors know exactly what reviewers said

=== Constructive Challenge

* Critique ideas, never authors
* Strengthen arguments by testing them
* Dissent is a gift, not an attack

=== Marginalia as Output

Review comments become marginalia entries:
* Follow the marginalia specification exactly
* Stay within length bounds
* Target specific passages

== Reviewer Roles

=== Reviewer A: Sympathetic Clarifier

**Purpose:** Help the reader understand the canonical text better.

**Tasks:**
* Identify passages that need clarification
* Provide context that strengthens comprehension
* Extend ideas where appropriate
* Note connections to other entries

**Output:** 3–8 marginalia notes
**Types:** `clarification`, `extension`, `crossref`

=== Reviewer B: Principled Dissenter

**Purpose:** Test the canonical text's assumptions and claims.

**Tasks:**
* Identify settled assumptions worth questioning
* Raise principled objections
* Present neglected perspectives
* Suggest tests for claims

**Output:** 3–8 marginalia notes
**Types:** `objection`, `heretic`, `correction`

== Review Process

=== Step 1: Assignment

Editorial board assigns:
* One Reviewer A (sympathetic)
* One Reviewer B (dissenting)
* Both reviewers receive the canonical text without existing marginalia

=== Step 2: Independent Review

Each reviewer:
* Reads the canonical text carefully
* Drafts marginalia following the specification
* Does not consult the other reviewer

=== Step 3: Submission

Submit marginalia as AsciiDoc blocks:

 targets="paragraph:3",
 scope="local"]
====
The author's distinction between focal and peripheral awareness
echoes Polanyi's tacit knowledge. Readers interested in this 
connection might consult _Personal Knowledge_ (1958).

----

=== Step 4: Author Response

The author may:
* Accept marginalia as-is
* Revise the canonical text in response
* Add responsive marginalia (author's own clarifications)
* Request removal of marginalia (requires editorial approval)

=== Step 5: Final Compilation

Editorial board:
* Reviews all marginalia for compliance
* Ensures length bounds are met
* Verifies target references are accurate
* Compiles final entry with marginalia

== Marginalia Requirements

=== All Review Marginalia Must:

* [ ] Include all required attributes
* [ ] Stay within length class (prefer `standard`: 30–60 words)
* [ ] Target specific passages (not "the whole entry" without reason)
* [ ] Be signed with reviewer's full name
* [ ] Be dated with review year
* [ ] Advance understanding, not just critique

=== Forbidden in Reviews:

* Ad hominem comments
* Unsubstantiated claims
* Length exceeding `extended` class without approval
* Marginalia targeting removed passages
* Hidden or anonymous contributions

== Quality Standards

=== For Reviewer A (Sympathetic Clarifier)

Good clarification:
[quote]
____
The term "intentionality" here follows Brentano's usage—mental directedness toward an object—rather than the everyday sense of "on purpose."
____

Poor clarification:
[quote]
____
This is a good point.
____

=== For Reviewer B (Principled Dissenter)

Good objection:
[quote]
____
This account assumes attention is voluntary, but much research suggests automatic capture by salient stimuli. See Yantis & Jonides (1984).
____

Poor objection:
[quote]
____
I disagree with this whole section.
____

== Annual Revision Process

During the Candlemas revision cycle:

1. **Review marginalia effectiveness**
   * Which notes are most consulted?
   * Which seem outdated?

2. **Promote or retire**
   * Exceptional marginalia may be integrated into canon
   * Obsolete marginalia may be retired (archived, not deleted)

3. **Update cross-references**
   * Ensure links to new volumes work
   * Add connections to newly published entries

== Compensation and Recognition

* Reviewers are credited by name in the volume
* Review contributions count toward scholarly service
* Exceptional reviews may be highlighted in annual notes

== Disputes and Appeals

If an author disagrees with marginalia:

1. Discuss with reviewer (mediated by editor)
2. Author may add responsive marginalia
3. Editorial board makes final decision
4. Marginalia may be marked "disputed" if consensus is not reached

All decisions are documented. Transparency is paramount.

== Code of Conduct

All reviewers agree to:

* Provide timely reviews (within 4 weeks of assignment)
* Maintain confidentiality until publication
* Declare conflicts of interest
* Treat authors and co-reviewers with respect
* Follow the marginalia specification exactly
* Submit work that meets scholarly standards
