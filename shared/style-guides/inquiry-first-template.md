## Article Structure

### I. The Question That Opens This Article

**(Orientation, not definition)**

Begin with one carefully chosen, generative question—the question that makes the article necessary.

- Why does this topic matter enough to ask about at all?
- What puzzle, tension, or uncertainty gives rise to it?

**Guidance:**
- This question should not be fully answerable.
- It should orient the reader toward wonder, not mastery.
- Ideally, it should feel slightly uncomfortable.

---

### II. What Is Commonly Said

**(Provisional understanding)**

Briefly summarize the prevailing or conventional account of the topic.

- What do textbooks, popular explanations, or authorities usually claim?
- What definitions or frameworks are most widely accepted?
- What assumptions are typically left unstated?

**Tone:**
- Neutral, concise, and non-dogmatic
- This section answers just enough to make deeper questions possible

---

### III. Questions Beneath the Answer

**(Critical excavation)**

Expose the assumptions hiding inside the common account.

**Possible prompts:**
- What must be true for this explanation to hold?
- What does this view emphasize—and what does it ignore?
- Who benefits from framing the topic this way?
- When did this understanding emerge, and why then?

This section should multiply questions, not resolve them.

---

### IV. Competing Ways of Seeing

**(Plural perspectives)**

Present 2–4 alternative interpretations, traditions, or frameworks, each introduced as a question.

**Examples:**
- How does this topic appear from a historical perspective?
- How is it understood differently across cultures or disciplines?
- What happens if we reverse a core assumption?
- What would a skeptic say?

**Important:**
- Do not declare a winner.
- Let tension remain visible.
- Contradiction is a feature, not a flaw.

---

### V. What Remains Unanswered

**(Living uncertainty)**

Name what is not known, unresolved, or actively debated.

This may include:
- Open scientific problems
- Philosophical disagreements
- Ethical ambiguities
- Missing voices or perspectives
- Questions we lack the tools to ask properly (yet)

This section signals that knowledge is alive, not complete.

---

### VI. Questions for the Reader

**(Maieutic prompts)**

Invite the reader into the inquiry directly.

**Suggested prompts:**
- Which explanation feels most convincing to you, and why?
- What assumptions do you bring to this topic?
- What experience in your own life complicates what you've read?
- What question would you add to this article?

These should be suitable for:
- Personal reflection
- Classroom discussion
- Salon or symposium use

---

### VII. Paths for Further Inquiry

**(Not "Further Reading")**

Instead of a bibliography, offer directions of exploration.

**Examples:**
- "To pursue this question historically, see…"
- "To approach this scientifically, investigate…"
- "To challenge this framing, compare it with…"
- "To deepen this inquiry, ask…"

You may optionally include references, but framed as tools, not authorities.

---

## Editorial Notes (Internal Use)

**Article Intent:**
- Is this article meant to unsettle, orient, or reframe?

**Intended Audience:**
- Child / General / Advanced / Faculty

**Inquiry Tags:**
- Ontology, Ethics, Epistemology, Systems, Language, Power, Meaning, etc.

## Guiding Principle (Canonical)

An encyclopædia should not be the place where questions go to die.  
It should be the place where better questions are learned.
