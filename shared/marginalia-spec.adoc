= Marginalia Specification

== Overview

Marginalia are scholarly annotations that appear alongside canonical text. They represent the ongoing conversation between thinkers across time, providing context, challenge, and extension to the primary text.

== Canon vs Marginalia Rule

=== Canonical Text
* Written by Public Domain ("Faculty") voices only
* Must stand alone if all marginalia is removed
* Represents the authoritative treatment of the topic
* Maintains coherent argument structure independent of annotations

=== Marginalia
* May include Adjunct, Heretic, and Synthetic voices
* Always marked, dated, targeted, and length-bounded
* Never essential to understanding the canonical text
* Provides scholarly conversation around the canonical text

== Marginalia Types

[cols="1,3,2"]
|===
| Type | Description | Typical Use

| `clarification`
| Explains or expands a concept for reader understanding
| Defining technical terms, providing context

| `objection`
| Raises principled disagreement with a claim
| Academic critique, methodological concerns

| `extension`
| Builds upon or develops an idea further
| Connecting to related work, modern applications

| `crossref`
| Points to related entries or external sources
| Inter-volume connections, bibliography

| `correction`
| Notes factual errors or updates to claims
| Historical corrections, new evidence

| `heretic`
| Articulates a forbidden or neglected perspective
| Challenging settled assumptions, dialectical tension

| `synthetic`
| AI-generated annotation for children's edition or pedagogy
| Simplified explanations, thinking scaffolds
|===

== Required Attributes

Every marginalia block MUST include:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[role=marginalia,
 type=objection,           <1>
 author="Herbert A. Simon", <2>
 status="adjunct",         <3>
 year="1971",              <4>
 length="42",              <5>
 targets="paragraph:4",    <6>
 scope="local"]            <7>
====
Attention functions less as a faculty than as an economic constraint,
limited by complexity and bounded rationality.
====
----
<1> *type* (required): One of the allowed type values
<2> *author* (required): Full name of the commentator
<3> *status* (required): `canonical`, `adjunct`, `heretic`, or `synthetic`
<4> *year* (required): Year of the comment or original statement
<5> *length* (required): Word count of the annotation
<6> *targets* (required): What element this annotates
<7> *scope* (required): `local` (this entry) or `global` (cross-entry)

== Length Classes

Marginalia must adhere to strict length limits:

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Class | Word Range | Usage

| short
| 10–25 words
| Brief clarifications, simple cross-references

| standard
| 30–60 words
| Most objections, extensions, corrections

| extended
| 80–120 words
| Rare; requires editorial approval; flagged for review
|===

== Target Syntax

Targets specify what element the marginalia annotates:

* `paragraph:3` — Third paragraph in the entry
* `section:introduction` — The introduction section
* `claim:intentionality` — A specific claim about intentionality
* `entry:Attention` — The entire entry (global reference)
* `volume:1` — Volume-level annotation

== Status Definitions

=== canonical
Reserved for the primary author of the entry. Used when the canonical author adds their own clarifying notes.

=== adjunct
Scholars who extend or clarify the canon. May agree or disagree, but work within the established framework.

=== heretic
Voices that challenge fundamental assumptions. Present forbidden or neglected perspectives that the canonical text does not consider.

=== synthetic
AI-generated annotations, typically for pedagogical purposes in the Children's Edition. Always clearly marked.

== Peer Review as Marginalia

Peer review outputs become marginalia rather than hidden reports:

* **Reviewer A**: Sympathetic clarifier (3–8 notes, `clarification` or `extension`)
* **Reviewer B**: Principled dissenter (3–8 notes, `objection` or `heretic`)

All review marginalia are:
* Signed with reviewer name
* Dated with review date
* Targeted to specific passages
* Short to standard length

== Editorial Policy

=== Approval Process
1. Author submits entry with canonical text
2. Editorial board assigns reviewers
3. Reviewers submit marginalia (not hidden reports)
4. Author may respond with additional marginalia
5. Final compilation reviewed for length compliance

=== Annual Candlemas Revision
During the annual revision cycle:
* High-value marginalia may be promoted into canon
* Outdated marginalia may be retired
* Length compliance is re-verified
* Cross-references are updated for new volumes

== Children's Edition Considerations

For the Children's Edition:
* Synthetic marginalia may be used for thinking scaffolds
* Language is simplified but ideas remain intact
* Open questions replace definitive closures
* "Side Note" synthetic voices provide gentle guidance

== Examples

=== Canonical Text Block

[source,asciidoc]
----
[role=canonical]
====
When you pay attention, your mind chooses one thing and lets other things fade.
You can notice this happening.

Try listening to two sounds at once. One becomes clear, and the other slips away.
This does not mean the other sound is gone. It means your mind is not holding it.

=== Clarification Marginalia

[source,asciidoc]
----
[role=marginalia,
 type=clarification,
 author="Side Note",
 status="synthetic",
 year="2026",
 length="22",
 targets="paragraph:2",
 scope="local"]
====
A "limit" can still be useful. A lantern shines by not lighting everything.

=== Heretic Marginalia

[source,asciidoc]
----
[role=marginalia,
 type=heretic,
 author="Simone Weil",
 status="heretic",
 year="1947",
 length="21",
 targets="entry:Attention",
 scope="global"]
====
Attention is not effort, but the suspension of the self.
