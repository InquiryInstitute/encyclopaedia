# Faculty Assignment Recommendations

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Consciousness** (Volume I)
**Current**: Darwin (Biological)
**Issue**: Darwin wrote about consciousness in animals, but it's not his primary focus
**Recommendation**: Replace with **William James** (biological/psychological consciousness) or **Thomas Huxley** (biological consciousness)

### 2. **Number** (Volume IV)
**Current**: Adam Smith (Economic)
**Issue**: Smith wrote about economics, not number theory or philosophy of mathematics
**Recommendation**: Replace with **Gottlob Frege** (logical foundations of number) or **Bertrand Russell** (philosophy of mathematics)

### 3. **Probability** (Volume IV)
**Current**: Karl Popper (Philosophical)
**Issue**: Popper wrote about falsification, not probability theory per se
**Recommendation**: Replace with **David Hume** (induction/probability) or **John Maynard Keynes** (probability theory, d. 1946)

### 4. **Ethics (Care)** (Volume IX)
**Current**: Nel Noddings
**Issue**: Need to verify death date (may have died 2022)
**Recommendation**: If not deceased, replace with **Simone de Beauvoir** (existential ethics with care elements, d. 1986)

### 5. **Form** (Volume VI)
**Current**: Kurt Gödel (Mathematical)
**Issue**: Gödel's work is about formal systems/logic, not aesthetic form
**Recommendation**: Keep but note it's mathematical/logical form, OR replace with **Plato** (Forms) but he's already used for Beauty

## Recommended Changes

### Priority 1 (Clear Mismatches)
1. **Number**: Smith → **Frege** or **Russell**
2. **Probability**: Popper → **Hume** or **Keynes**

### Priority 2 (Questionable but Workable)
3. **Consciousness**: Darwin → **James** or **Huxley** (Darwin works but not ideal)
4. **Form**: Keep Gödel but clarify it's mathematical form

### Priority 3 (Verify First)
5. **Ethics (Care)**: Verify Noddings death date; if alive, use **de Beauvoir**
