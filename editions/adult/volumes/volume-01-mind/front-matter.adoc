== Editorial Covenant

The Encyclopædia is a seasonal, multi-volume reference work that presents fundamental questions of human inquiry through the voices of historical thinkers. It does not synthesize, reconcile, or resolve. It presents.

**Authority through plurality.** Each entry may be contested by marginalia. Each topic may fracture into multiple perspectives. The Encyclopædia holds disagreement without losing composure.

**The dead speak here.** All contributors are deceased. Living thinkers appear only as cited sources or future reader annotations. This stabilizes authority, prevents ideological drift, and aligns with the Borges / Britannica lineage.

**No final word.** Every entry is provisional. The Encyclopædia is revised annually at Candlemas. Marginalia accumulate. The work remains alive through its incompleteness.

== Scheme of Inquiry

The Encyclopædia is organized into twelve volumes, each corresponding to a fundamental domain of inquiry:

*Volume I: Mind* — Consciousness, cognition, perception, self, attention, memory, intelligence, belief, emotion, will, experience, thought, sensation, sleep, dream, imagination, abstraction, affect, awareness, habit, reason.

*Volume II: Language & Meaning* — Language, meaning, symbol, interpretation, grammar, metaphor, narrative, reference, translation, voice, writing, silence, untranslatable.

*Volume III: Nature (Becoming)* — Nature, life, evolution, adaptation, complexity, ecology, form, growth, organism, process, artificial life, extinction.

*Volume IV: Measure* — Time, number, probability, chance, dimension, error, infinity, limit, scale, measurement, uncertainty.

*Volume V: Society* — Agency, power, culture, authority, class, community, institution, ritual, role, tradition, crowd, network.

*Volume VI: Art & Form* — Art, beauty, form, craft, design, imitation, style, taste, ornament, kitsch.

*Volume VII: Knowledge* — Knowledge, truth, belief, certainty, evidence, explanation, ignorance, method, proof, pseudoscience, revelation.

*Volume VIII: History* — History, memory, archive, event, periodization, progress, revolution, tradition, myth, trauma.

*Volume IX: Ethics* — Ethics, justice, care, duty, good, responsibility, rights, virtue, evil, harm.

*Volume X: Machines* — Machine, technology, automation, control, efficiency, feedback, optimization, system, artificial intelligence, tool.

*Volume XI: Futures* — Future, risk, forecast, innovation, planning, scenario, speculation, collapse, apocalypse, resilience.

*Volume XII: Limits* — Limit, freedom, constraint, death, necessity, responsibility, absurd, silence.

Each volume is published seasonally, but the volumes themselves are not organized by season. They are organized by domain.

== Faculty Charter

**All contributors are deceased.** This is not negotiable. Living thinkers may appear only as cited sources or future reader marginalia.

**Plurality without synthesis.** Where a concept can be responsibly defined, it receives one article. Where it fractures under inquiry, it receives several—without synthesis. Constellation topics (e.g., "Mind (Embodied)", "Mind (Collective)") represent this fracture.

**Voice fidelity.** Each entry is authored by a historical figure, speaking in their own voice. Marginalia may object, clarify, extend, or dissent—but the canonical text remains authoritative within its own perspective.

**No hierarchy of truth.** A "heretic" marginalia is not less true than a "canonical" entry. It is differently positioned. The Encyclopædia presents, it does not judge.

**The dead speak, the living annotate.** This is the fundamental rule. It stabilizes authority, prevents present-day churn, and makes the Encyclopædia feel finished yet alive.

== How This Encyclopædia Is Organized

**Entries are alphabetized** within each volume, with two exceptions:

1. **Constellation topics** are alphabetized by their base topic (e.g., "Mind (Embodied)" appears under "M").
2. **Closing entries** always appear last, after all main entries, and are not alphabetized.

**Entry types** are not distinguished visually. All entries receive equal typographic treatment. The distinction between "Major," "Standard," and "Boundary" entries is editorial, not visual.

**Marginalia** appear in the outer margin. They are parallel voices, equal in authority to the canonical text. Marginalia may object, clarify, extend, or dissent—but the canonical text remains authoritative within its own perspective.

**Cross-references** use the format: `See Volume II: Language & Meaning, "Translation"`.

== Revision & Provenance Statement

The Encyclopædia is revised annually at Candlemas (February 2). Revisions may include:
* New entries
* Revisions to existing entries (with provenance noted)
* Additional marginalia
* Corrections of fact

All revisions are tracked. The current edition is 2026. Previous editions remain available for reference.

**Provenance.** Each entry includes:
* Canonical author (faculty member)
* Faculty ID (e.g., `a.peirce`)
* Status (canonical, adjunct, heretic)
* Entry type (standard, boundary, closing)
* Edition year

== Conventions & Symbols

**Typography:**
* Entry titles: UPPERCASE, centered, spanning both columns
* Canonical text: two-column, dense, readable
* Marginalia: outer margin, compact, subordinate

**Symbols:**
* ● Single-article topic
* ✦ Constellation topic (multiple perspectives)
* No visual distinction between entry types

**Abbreviations:**
* Vol. = Volume
* Ed. = Edition
* Cf. = Compare
* See = Cross-reference

**Citations:** Inline citations use author-date format: `(Peirce, 1877)`. Full references appear in entry bibliographies.

== Instructions for Use

**For the first-time reader:**
1. Begin with Volume I. It contains the constitutional front matter.
2. Read "How This Encyclopædia Is Organized" (above).
3. Choose any entry. The Encyclopædia is designed for non-linear reading.
4. Read the canonical text, then the marginalia. Both are authoritative.
5. Follow cross-references as needed.

**For the returning reader:**
* Each volume is self-contained for its domain.
* Use the index (in Volume XII) for cross-volume references.
* Marginalia accumulate; check annual revisions.

**For the scholar:**
* All entries cite primary sources.
* Marginalia provide alternative perspectives.
* The Encyclopædia does not synthesize; you must.

**For the curious:**
* Open any volume. Read any entry. Follow your interest.
* The Encyclopædia rewards browsing as much as systematic reading.

== Volume I: Mind

This volume concerns itself with the fundamental questions of consciousness, cognition, and mental life. It does not attempt to resolve the mind-body problem, to unify theories of consciousness, or to synthesize competing accounts of intelligence. It presents them.

**What this volume does:** It presents multiple perspectives on mind, consciousness, self, attention, memory, belief, emotion, and related phenomena. Each perspective speaks in its own voice. Marginalia provide objections, clarifications, extensions, and dissents.

**What this volume does not do:** It does not attempt to reconcile phenomenology with computationalism, or to synthesize James with Freud. It presents both, and lets the reader hold the tension.

== How to Use This Volume

**Alphabetical ordering:** All entries are alphabetized by title. "Mind (Embodied)" appears under "M", not under "E".

**Constellation topics:** Some topics (e.g., Consciousness, Mind, Self) have multiple entries representing different perspectives. These are alphabetized by their base topic.

**Closing entries:** Entries marked as "closing" appear at the end of the volume, after all main entries. They are not alphabetized.

**Marginalia:** Notes appear in the outer margin. Read the canonical text first, then the marginalia. Both are authoritative.

**Cross-references:** Use the format `See Volume II: Language & Meaning, "Translation"` to navigate between volumes.
