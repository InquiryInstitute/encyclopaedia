== Preface to Volume I

This first volume of _The Encyclopædia_ opens with *Mind*, fitting for Candlemas—the feast of light returning, when we emerge from winter's interiority to examine what has been germinating in darkness.

The entries herein explore the territory of mental life: attention and its limits, consciousness and its mysteries, the interplay of thought, memory, and will. We begin where inquiry itself begins—in the activity of a mind seeking to understand.

== Editorial Note

This Adult Edition presents canonical texts from public domain Faculty voices. Marginalia from adjunct, heretic, and synthetic commentators appears in the margins, marked and attributed according to the _Marginalia Specification_.

The canonical text stands alone. If all marginalia were removed, each entry would remain coherent and complete. The marginalia exists to show the ongoing conversation—agreements, objections, extensions—that scholarship requires.

== How to Read This Volume

=== Canonical Text

The main body of each entry, written by the attributed Faculty author, appears in the central column. This is the authoritative treatment of the topic.

=== Marginalia

Annotations appear in the outer margin, linked to specific passages. Each note includes:

* *Author*: Who wrote the annotation
* *Status*: Canonical, Adjunct, Heretic, or Synthetic
* *Type*: Clarification, Objection, Extension, etc.
* *Year*: When the note was written or the original statement made

=== Cross-References

Links to related entries appear as `→ See: Entry Name`. These may point to entries within this volume or to other volumes.

== Acknowledgments

The editors thank the Inquiry Institute for stewarding this project, the Faculty for their voices, and the reviewers for their principled marginalia.
