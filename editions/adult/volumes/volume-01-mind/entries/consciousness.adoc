[CANONICAL TEXT TO BE GENERATED]

This entry will explore consciousness as durée (duration)—the continuous flow of inner experience that cannot be adequately captured by spatial metaphors or discrete measurements.

Topics to cover:
- Duration vs. clock time
- The qualitative multiplicity of conscious states
- Memory and the persistence of the past in the present
- Intuition as the mode of knowing consciousness
- Critique of associationist psychology
- Freedom and the creative evolution of mind
