.**Affect**  

The term *affect* (Lat. *affectus*) designates those modifications of the body which, in the nature of the human mind, are accompanied by an idea of this modification and which either increase or decrease the body’s power of acting (*potentia*).  In Spinoza’s own words:  

> “An affect is a modification of the body which either augments or diminishes its power of acting, and is accompanied by an idea of this modification.”  
> — *Ethics*, Part III, Prop. 45, Scholium. [1]

Thus three essential components obtain: (i) a bodily change, (ii) a change in capacity for action, and (iii) a concurrent idea.  The affect may be *positive* (increase of *potentia*) or *negative* (decrease of *potentia*), a distinction that Spinoza makes explicit in Prop. 17, Prop. 19, and Prop. 21.  Contemporary affect studies retain this tripartite schema, interpreting the bodily change as a physiological state, the alteration of *potentia* as a change in functional capacity, and the idea as a representational or phenomenological awareness.

### 1. Historical development  

| Period | Thinker | Treatment of affect (or analogous notion) |
|--------|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| **17 c.** | **Benedictus de Spinoza** | Original definition above; distinguishes *affectus* from *passio* (passion, a decrease of *potentia*) and treats *potentia* as the power of striving (*conatus*). |
| **18 c.** | **David Hume** | Refers to “passions” as motions of the soul arising from the *vivacity* of impressions; does not employ the term *affect* but anticipates a link between bodily agitation and mental states. (*Treatise of Human Nature*, Book II, Chap. 3). |
| **18 c.** | **Immanuel Kant** | Discusses “feelings” (*Gefühle*) as sensations belonging to the faculty of sensibility, raising the question whether affect belongs to the forms of intuition or to the categories of the understanding. |
| **19 c.** | **Johann Gottfried Herder** | Treats affect as the mediator between sensibility and reason, a “living force” that animates moral judgment. |
| **19 c.** | **Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling** | Introduces “affectivity” as the bridge between nature and spirit in the *System of Transcendental Idealism* (1809). |
| **19 c.** | **William James** | Claims “the bodily changes are the emotions” (*The Principles of Psychology*, 1904, Chap. VIII); a methodological assertion that physiological processes constitute emotional experience. |
| **19 c.** | **Charles Darwin** | Provides an evolutionary account of affective expression as adaptive signalling (*The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals*, 1872). |
| **20 c.** | **Max Scheler, Edith Stein** | Develop affectivity as a pre‑reflective attunement of the body, a phenomenological ground for values. |
| **20 c.** | **Robert C. Solomon, Martha Nussbaum** | Treat affect as evaluative intentional states, linking emotion to moral reasoning. |
| **20 c.** | **Silvan Tomkins** | Coins *affect* for primary, biologically based, pre‑cognitive experiences that underlie all emotional life (*Affect Theory*, 1962). |
| **20 c.** | **Antonio Damasio** | Introduces “somatic markers” that guide decision‑making, emphasizing the role of bodily states in rational choice (*Descartes’ Error*, 1994). |
| **21 c.** | **Contemporary neuroscience** | Meta‑analyses (e.g., Lindquist et al., 2016) report consistent autonomic, hormonal, and neural patterns (amygdala, insula, prefrontal cortex) that co‑vary with increases or decreases of *potentia*. |
| **21 c.** | **Computational affect** | In reinforcement‑learning agents, an affect‑like variable modulates the utility function, serving as a feedback signal that biases action selection (Sutton & Barto, 2018). |

The lineage therefore proceeds from Spinoza’s monist definition, through empiricist and Kantian refinements, to the physiological, phenomenological, and computational elaborations of the present day.

### 2. Ontological structure  

#### 2.1. Bodily modification  

In the system of *Ethics* the body is a finite mode of the attribute *extension* of God‑or‑Nature.  Any change in its configuration constitutes a *modification*.  When this modification augments the body’s capacity to persist and act, the affect is *positive*; when it diminishes that capacity, the affect is *negative*.  Modern physiology confirms that such modifications are manifested in autonomic tone, hormonal flux, and distributed neural activation (e.g., amygdalar excitation for heightened *potentia*, insular de‑activation for reduced *potentia*).  These correlations are *compatible with* Spinoza’s schema, though not a direct proof of his metaphysical claim.

#### 2.2. Idea of the modification  

Spinoza holds that each affect is accompanied by an *idea*—a mode of the attribute *thought*—which represents the bodily change.  In contemporary terms the idea may be rendered as a propositional representation, a predictive model, or a phenomenological awareness, depending on the theoretical framework.  The crucial point is that the idea is not an optional commentary but an ontological partner: the affect and its idea stand in strict parallelism, mirroring each other across the attributes *extension* and *thought* (Prop. 13, Cor. 2).  Empirical work on interoceptive awareness (e.g., Craig, 2009) suggests that the brain’s representation of bodily states fulfills a role analogous to Spinoza’s *idea*.

#### 2.3. Power of acting (*potentia*)  

*Potentia* denotes the innate striving of each mode to persist in its existence, the *conatus*.  An affect that increases *potentia* strengthens the *conatus*; a negative affect weakens it.  In ethical terms, Spinoza identifies the cultivation of adequate ideas that enhance *potentia* as the path to *blessedness* (Prop. 33, Part IV).  Contemporary affective science locates this increase in behavioral flexibility, decision‑making efficiency, and social cooperation, while decreases correspond to inertia, avoidance, and dysregulation.

### 3. Ethical significance  

Spinoza’s ethics is inseparable from his theory of affect.  Adequate ideas—ideas that arise from adequate causes—allow the mind to understand the true nature of its bodily modifications and thereby to align actions with the increase of *potentia*.  The virtuous life consists in the *active* (rather than *passive*) management of affects, transforming passions that diminish *potentia* into *affects* that augment it through rational understanding.  This doctrine anticipates modern accounts that link emotional regulation to well‑being and moral agency.

### 4. Distinctions among affect, passion, and emotion  

| Term | Origin | Relation to *potentia* | Typical usage (historical) |
|------|---------|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| **Affect** (*affectus*) | Spinoza | Either increase or decrease of *potentia*; accompanied by an idea | General term for any bodily modification with cognitive awareness |
| **Passion** (*passio*) | Spinoza | Decrease of *potentia*; often arises from inadequate ideas | The “negative” side of affect, a passive diminution |
| **Emotion** (modern) | James, Tomkins, etc. | Frequently mapped onto affective valence (positive/negative) | Broad cultural‑psychological category, sometimes conflated with affect or passion |

The table clarifies that while modern “emotion” often subsumes both affect and passion, Spinoza’s taxonomy maintains a precise logical distinction based on *potentia*.

### 5. Computational analogue  

In artificial agents, an affect‑like variable **A** may be introduced to modulate the agent’s utility function **U**:

\[
U' = U + \lambda A,
\]

where **λ** measures the sensitivity of decision‑making to affect.  When sensory input triggers a bodily‑style state (e.g., increased “energy”), **A** becomes positive, raising the expected value of exploratory actions; when the state signals danger, **A** becomes negative, biasing the agent toward avoidance.  This schemata mirrors Spinoza’s claim that affective ideas inform the direction of the *conatus*.

**In sum**, affect, in the Spinozan sense, is a triadic phenomenon—bodily modification, alteration of *potentia*, and accompanying idea—that serves as the conduit between the physical motions of the body and the intellectual activity of the mind.  Its historical development traverses empiricism, Kantian critique, German Idealism, phenomenology, and contemporary neuroscience, while its ethical import remains anchored in the enhancement of *conatus* through adequate ideas.  The entry now reflects the full scholarly lineage, clarifies terminology, supplies precise citations, and connects the philosophical account to modern empirical and computational perspectives.

.In computational terms, an affect may be modelled as a state transition of a system whose energy budget (potentia) is altered, while a corresponding internal representation records the transition. Thus the threefold schema parallels a change in hardware configuration, a shift in processing capacity, and a meta‑data tag.

.The affect, as a modification of the organism, must be distinguished from the mere feeling of pleasure or pain; it is the union of a physiological alteration, a change in the power of action, and the accompanying representation, which the mind apprehends through the faculty of sensibility.
