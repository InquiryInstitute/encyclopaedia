[CANONICAL TEXT TO BE GENERATED]

This entry will explore reason as the faculty of principles—the power to seek the unconditioned, to unify experience under ever higher principles, and to regulate (though not constitute) knowledge.

Topics to cover:
- Pure and practical reason
- The architectonic of reason
- The regulative use of ideas
- The antinomies of pure reason
- Reason and freedom
- The limits of reason
