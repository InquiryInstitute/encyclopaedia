.**Belief**

**Overview**  
The notion of belief occupies a central place in the doctrine of inquiry that I have set forth in *The Fixation of Belief* (1878) and later in *The Logic of Science* (1903).  It is not a mere mental picture nor a passive assent; it is a *habit of action*—a self‑consistent disposition that guides conduct and is, in turn, subject to the corrective force of doubt and communal criticism.  The following exposition integrates the historical lineage of the term, its logical formalisation, and its pragmatic and ethical import, while attending to the most recent scholarly refinements.

### Definition and Scope  

A belief is *a habit of action* that inclines the believer to behave as though the proposition it represents were true.  In the language of my 1878 paper, “A belief is a habit of action; it is the starting‑point of inquiry, the *fixation* which must be examined, tested, and, where necessary, *settled*.”¹  Thus belief is a mental disposition *both epistemic*—concerning what we take to be known—and *pragmatic*—concerning what we take to do.  It differs from a mere representation in that it carries a *propensity* to guide conduct, a potentiality that may be realized under appropriate circumstances.

### Historical Background  

**Plato and Aristotle.**  The ancient distinction between *doxa* (opinion) and *epistēmē* (knowledge) anticipates the later separation of belief from knowledge, but Plato’s hierarchy is limited to an epistemic ordering.  I have emphasized that belief is distinguished on the basis of its *pragmatic consequences* rather than merely its justificatory status.  Aristotle, in the *Posterior Analytics*, links knowledge to demonstrative proof and treats *doxa* as a non‑demonstrative assent; his account, however, does not furnish a technical notion of belief that I later develop.  

**Descartes and Kant.**  Descartes’ methodic doubt regards belief as a provisional assent awaiting the test of certainty.  Kant’s treatment of *Glaube* (belief) is often misread.  He reserves belief for *practical* faith—e.g., the moral postulates of God and freedom—that is *regulative* rather than constitutive of knowledge; it is not granted a rational warrant beyond the limits of possible experience, but rather a *practical necessity* for the moral law.²  

**American Pragmatism.**  In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the concept was re‑oriented toward its functional role in inquiry.  My own essay “The Fixation of Belief” (1878) distinguishes *fixation* (the initial habit) from *settlement* (the revised habit after inquiry).  William James, in *The Will to Believe* (1896), stresses the personal commitment that may be justified when a genuine, forced, live, and momentous option presents itself.  John Dewey, in *Logic: The Theory of Inquiry* (1938), treats belief as a *hypothesis* subject to experimental verification within a *democratic community of inquirers*; his treatment, however, is more nuanced than a simple hypothesis‑testing model, emphasizing the iterative refinement of habits.³

### Logical Analysis  

To render belief in a formal schema we introduce the binary predicate  

\[
B(x,p)\; \text{“x holds the belief that p”}
\]

and the propensity predicate  

\[
A(x,p)\; \text{“x is disposed to act as if p were true.”}
\]

The relation is **modal**, not truth‑functional; belief makes the action *possible* rather than *necessary*.  Accordingly we write  

\[
B(x,p)\;\Rightarrow\;\Diamond A(x,p) \tag{1}
\]

where “\(\Rightarrow\)” denotes a conditional potential and “\(\Diamond\)” the modal operator of possibility.  The arrow therefore signals that a belief creates a *potential* for action that may be actualised under suitable circumstances; it does not entail that the action is presently performed.

**Semiotic triad.**  Within my theory of signs, a belief constitutes a *sign* (the representamen) that stands for an *object* (the proposition) to an *interpretant* (the believer’s consequent mental state).  The interpretant itself is a sign, and this *iterated* interpretant furnishes the *habit of interpretation* that stabilises conduct.  The recursion matters because each new interpretant reinforces the sign relation, thereby consolidating the habit until a more stable habit—produced by further inquiry—supplants it.  (Cf. *Collected Papers*, vol. II, pp. 254‑255.)⁴

### Pragmatic Theory of Belief  

The pragmatic maxim, fully stated, reads:  

> “Consider the practical effects of the objects of your conception. Then, your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object.”  

Applied to belief, the maxim dictates that the *meaning* of a belief is exhausted by the *conceivable practical consequences* of its adoption.  For example, the belief “the sun will rise tomorrow” carries the practical effect of prompting us to plan activities for the next day; the habit of waking early is thus sustained by that belief.  The maxim therefore converts a merely verbal proposition into a *testable habit of action*.

---

### Ethical Dimension  

A belief must be *open to criticism*; the community of inquirers bears collective responsibility for the health of its habits.  When a belief proves inadequate—i.e., when it fails to secure the expected practical consequences—it is to be replaced by a habit of *greater stability*.  This ethical injunction links the logical analysis to the social practice of inquiry: the *self‑correcting* nature of belief is realized only through communal scrutiny and the willingness to entertain doubt.⁵

### Later Developments  

Subsequent scholars have elaborated the Peircean framework.  R. B. Mackenzie’s work on *belief‑revision* adopts the habit‑theoretic view to model how new evidence prompts the displacement of an old habit by a more stable one.  Carnap’s inductive logic provides a probabilistic formalism that can be read as a quantitative counterpart to the modal schema (1).  Later pragmatists—Rorty, Davidson, and contemporary philosophers of mind—have taken up the idea of belief as a *state* in a computational system, echoing the parallel between a habit and a finite‑automaton state.  Though these developments extend beyond the original scope, they attest to the enduring relevance of the Peircean conception of belief.

### Conclusion  

Belief, in the Peircean sense, is simultaneously:

* a *habit of action*—a self‑consistent disposition that guides conduct;
* a *sign relation*—a triadic semiotic structure whose iterated interpretants stabilize that habit;
* a *provisional hypothesis*—subject to the pragmatic maxim, communal criticism, and possible replacement by a habit of greater stability.

In this way the concept unites logical, semiotic, pragmatic, and ethical dimensions, furnishing a comprehensive account of how humans navigate the world through belief.

Yet belief, reduced to a merely behavioural habit, forgets that true obedience arises from the attentional renunciation of self‑interest; it is not a settled disposition but a continual opening to the void where the divine may be heard, lest belief become another form of idolatry.

Belief, in the sense here employed, may be modelled as a state‑transition rule within a computational system: given a datum, the rule predisposes the system to act as if the datum were true, pending revision by further input (doubt) and external verification.
