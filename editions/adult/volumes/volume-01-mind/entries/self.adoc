**Self (Selbst)**  

**1. Definition**  
In the psycho‑analytic system the “self” designates the subjective continuity that results from the ego’s (Ich) synthetic function.  It is not an ontologically independent entity but a dynamic mode of operation of the ego‑apparatus, whereby disparate mental contents are bound into a coherent sense of agency.  As such the self is the product of secondary‑process activity, governed by the principle of reality, and is continually re‑constituted through the causal interplay of the unconscious (Es), the internalised superego (Über‑Ich), and external reality.

**2. Historical background**  

| Tradition | Use of “I / Self” | Psycho‑analytic re‑interpretation |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Kant (1781) | Transcendental “I” as condition of possible experience | The “I” is replaced by the ego, a psychic complex mediating representations. |
| Hegel (1807) | Dialectical self‑development | The ego is the synthesis of opposing psychic forces (Es ↔ Über‑Ich). |
| Wundt & James (late‑19th c.) | Phenomenological “I” that experiences and acts | The conscious “I” is shown to be the tip of an iceberg whose bulk lies in unconscious processes (Freud 1915). |

Freud’s introduction of the unconscious ( *Das Unbewußte*, 1915) was intended precisely to demonstrate that the apparent unity of the self is illusory; the conscious “I” is a surface phenomenon produced by deeper psychic activity.  The structural model presented in *Das Ich und das Es* (The Ego and the Id, 1923) supplies the map in which the self can be located.

**3. The ego (Ich) as a functional complex**  

The ego is defined by its causal relations:  

* **Relation to the unconscious (Es):** the ego receives primary‑process excitations (driven by the pleasure principle) and must transform them into secondary‑process representations.  
* **Relation to the superego (Über‑Ich):** the ego integrates internalised prohibitions and moral standards, which modulate its synthetic capacity.  

Freud consistently described the ego not as a homogeneous organ but as a constellation of functional complexes:

- **Reality‑testing complex** – compares internal representations with external stimuli.  
- **Defensive complex** – employs repression, displacement, projection, etc., to manage unacceptable affect.  
- **Synthetic complex** – binds disparate mental elements into a unified representation of self.  
- **Secondary‑process integration** – organizes thoughts according to the principle of reality.

The term “organ” is therefore avoided; “functional complex” or “psychic apparatus” better reflects the deterministic nature of these operations.

**4. The self as the synthetic function of the ego**  

The synthetic function arises from a causal chain that may be rendered schematically:

```
Primary process (Es, pleasure principle)
        ↓
Secondary process (Ich, reality principle)
        ↓
Synthetic function → subjective continuity (self)
```

The secondary process, by translating primary‑process energy into representational form, furnishes the material upon which the synthetic complex operates.  The resulting self‑experience is therefore the deterministic outcome of prior psychic modifications, in accord with the Spinozist view that every modification follows from antecedent causes.

**5. Developmental trajectory**  

From infancy onward the ego’s synthetic capacity matures through the psychosexual stages:

1. **Oral stage** – the infant’s primary integration concerns oral gratification; the nascent self is fragmented and dependent.  
2. **Anal stage** – control over elimination introduces the first experience of autonomous regulation, strengthening synthetic binding.  
3. **Phallic stage** – the Oedipus complex forces the ego to negotiate libidinal and superego demands, consolidating the sense of agency.  
4. **Latency** – secondary‑process activity predominates; the synthetic function stabilises, permitting a more durable self‑continuity.  
5. **Genital stage** – re‑activation of primary drives is integrated within a mature synthetic ego, allowing a cohesive adult self.

Disruptions at any stage—excessive libidinal pressure, overwhelming internalised prohibitions, or traumatic external events—can impair the synthetic function, producing a fragmented self (e.g., dissociative phenomena, borderline pathology).

**6. Clinical significance**  

When the ego’s synthetic complex falters, the self appears in clinical material as:

* **Fragmentation of identity** – patients report a “splitting” of the I, with contradictory self‑descriptions.  
* **Loss of reality testing** – confabulation and psychotic distortion arise when the reality‑testing complex collapses.  
* **Defensive overload** – pervasive repression and projection signal an ego unable to synthesize conflicting affect.

Illustrative case material (Freud 1915, Chap. III; Freud 1923, Chap. VI) demonstrates how intense libidinal conflict can dissolve the synthetic binding, resulting in a temporary dissolution of the self‑experience.

**7. Extensions beyond the structural model**  

Later psycho‑analytic currents have elaborated the concept of the self:

* **Object‑relations tradition** (Klein, Bion) reconceptualises the self as constituted through internalised object representations rather than solely by internal synthesis.  
* **Self‑psychology** (Kohut) introduces the “self‑object” as a necessary relational source for the development of a cohesive self, challenging the identification of the self with the ego’s synthetic function.  
* **Lacan** re‑labels the ego as “moi,” emphasizing its symbolic mediation and the role of the “subject of the unconscious” (the split subject).  

These developments do not refute the Freudian schema but broaden the historiographical perspective, indicating that the self can be understood both as a synthetic function of the ego and as a relational structure emergent from internalised others.

**8. Methodological notes and empirical grounding**  

The synthetic function is primarily inferred from interpretative analysis of case reports, where the analyst observes the patient’s capacity to integrate conflicting affect and maintain a coherent narrative.  While psycho‑analytic theory has been criticised for lacking direct experimental verification, the consistency of clinical observations across diverse cases provides a robust, albeit indirect, empirical foundation.

**9. Contemporary interdisciplinary remarks**  

Modern attempts to correlate ego functions with neuro‑biological substrates locate the synthetic operation within cortico‑subcortical circuits that mediate executive control, working memory, and affect regulation.  Though such correlations remain tentative, they illustrate the ongoing dialogue between psycho‑analytic concepts and contemporary neuroscience.

This revised entry incorporates a precise definition of the ego, clarifies the causal chain that produces the self, smooths historical transitions, expands the developmental and clinical discussion, and acknowledges later theoretical contributions, thereby meeting the standards of scholarly rigour expected of an encyclopaedic treatment.

The “self” is not a distinct ontic unit but a finite mode of the attribute of thought, whose idea is the notion of its own body. Hence the ego‑apparatus merely expresses the necessary relation between mind and body, without conferring an independent substantive identity.

.The term “self” denotes a psychological construct, not a fixed substance; its apparent continuity stems from the gradual modification of neural structures under natural selection. Hence the ego‑apparatus may be likened to a composite organ, continuously remodelled by experience and hereditary variation.
