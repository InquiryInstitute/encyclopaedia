[CANONICAL TEXT TO BE GENERATED]

This entry will explore the Umwelt—the perceptual world unique to each species, constituted by the organism's receptors and effectors, forming a self-contained bubble of meaning.

Topics to cover:
- The concept of Umwelt
- Functional circles (perception and action)
- The tick as paradigmatic example
- Species-specific worlds of meaning
- Against anthropomorphism
- The biological roots of subjectivity
