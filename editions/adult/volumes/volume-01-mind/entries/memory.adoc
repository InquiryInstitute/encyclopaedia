produce.**Memory**

The living mind retains the past not as a mere catalogue of images but as a lived *durée*—the qualitative, indivisible flow of experience that resists any spatialised, container‑like description. In this entry the Bergsonian perspective is presented first, then related to contemporary phenomenology and to the most salient findings of modern psychology and neurobiology. The aim is to show how the intuitionist analysis of memory can be juxtaposed with third‑person measurements without reducing the former to the latter.

### 1. Bergson’s Bifurcation of Memory  

Bergson distinguishes two modes of retention (Bergson, *Matière et Mémoire*, 1896; *L’Évolution créatrice*, 1907, § 85‑92).

| Mode | Phenomenology | Functional illustration |
|------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Mémoire‑habituelle** (habitual memory) | The past is incorporated into the present body‑scheme; it no longer appears as a distinct datum but as a *law‑like* tendency that guides action automatically. | A native speaker uttering a sentence without attending to the grammatical rules; the motor pattern of riding a bicycle. |
| **Mémoire‑pure** (pure memory) | The past remains a qualitative datum that can be summoned at will. Retrieval is an *act of will* that re‑creates the original lived moment, allowing the mind to insert a singularity into the flow of *durée*. | The sudden, vivid recollection of a childhood street, accompanied by the feeling of *re‑living* the scene. |

The distinction is not merely taxonomic. Habitual memory expresses the **mechanistic regularity** of the organism—repetitions that can be described in terms of physiological pathways—whereas pure memory expresses the **autonomous orientation** of consciousness, capable of bringing a former state into the present independently of any present stimulus. Bergson never denied that the body provides the material substrate for both modes; he insisted that the *qualitative* aspect of pure memory exceeds any purely quantitative, neuro‑mechanical account.

### 2. Phenomenological Structure of Memory  

#### 2.1. Temporal Continuity  

In *durée* the remembered event retains its internal temporal relations. The melody that one hears in recollection is not a succession of isolated notes but a flow that preserves its original tempo and expressive contour. This continuity distinguishes memory from the spatialised image‑représentative, which Bergson treats as a mere *snapshot* that can be displaced without altering its internal order.

#### 2.2. The Image‑Représentative  

Bergson separates the *image*—a mental copy that can be manipulated, compared, or erased—from *mémoire‑pure*. The image serves practical functions (planning, imagination) but does not itself constitute the lived recollection of a past moment. It is a derivative product, whereas pure memory is the direct re‑presentation of the lived past.

#### 2.3. Memory and Imagination  

Memory and imagination are mutually enriching. Pure memory supplies the raw material of lived experience; imagination recombines these materials, generating novel *images* that can later become part of the memory stream when they are lived through. This dynamic explains how personal narrative is continuously created without collapsing into a static archive.

### 3. Comparative Phenomenology  

| Philosopher | View of Memory | Relation to Bergson |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| William James | “Stream of consciousness” where memory is a flow punctuated by *retention* and *protention* | Overlaps with Bergson’s *durée*; James emphasizes the functional continuity of consciousness, whereas Bergson stresses the qualitative *re‑living* of pure memory. |
| Edmund Husserl | Retention (immediate past) and protention (immediate future) as temporal structures of consciousness | Husserl’s retention resembles habitual memory; Bergson adds the *act of will* that can retrieve a remote past beyond the horizon of retention. |
| Immanuel Kant | Memory as the synthesis of successive representations under the transcendental unity of apperception | Kant’s *empirical* synthesis parallels habitual memory; Bergson’s pure memory points to a *transcendental freedom* that can summon a past state independently of causal determinism. |

These comparisons locate Bergson within a broader phenomenological tradition while highlighting his unique claim that memory can be both law‑like and freely re‑presented.

### 4. Contemporary Scientific Developments  

Modern cognitive science distinguishes **procedural** (habit) and **episodic** (declarative) memory systems, a taxonomy that echoes Bergson’s bifurcation.

* **Procedural memory** – supported by basal‑ganglia circuits, it underlies the automatic execution of skills (e.g., language fluency, motor habits).  
* **Episodic memory** – dependent on hippocampal–cortical networks, it enables the vivid re‑experience of past events, often accompanied by a sense of *mental time travel* (Tulving, 1983).

Neuropsychological evidence (e.g., Squire, 1992) shows that lesions can impair one system while leaving the other intact, confirming the functional independence Bergson intuited. Moreover, phenomenological studies of flash‑bulb and trauma memories demonstrate that the *re‑living* quality Bergson described is empirically observable as heightened vividness and emotional intensity (Brown & Kulik, 1977).

These findings do not refute Bergson’s claim that pure memory resists a wholly neuro‑mechanistic reduction; rather, they illustrate that the *qualitative* aspect of recollection coexists with identifiable neural correlates.

### 5. Methodological Note: Bridging First‑Person and Third‑Person Perspectives  

A *dual‑aspect* approach treats each act of remembering as both a lived experience (first‑person description) and a neural event (third‑person measurement). The phenomenological description supplies the *what* and *how* of re‑living, while neurobiology supplies the *where* and *when* of activation patterns. By maintaining the autonomy of each perspective, one avoids the reduction of the lived *durée* to mere data, yet remains open to empirical confirmation where it is appropriate.

Through this expanded treatment the entry preserves Bergson’s original insight—memory as lived *durée*—while integrating the terminology, examples, and empirical references demanded by contemporary scholarship.

.Il faut toutefois rappeler que la prétendue incompatibilité entre la durée bergsonienne et la description spatiale n’est pas absolue ; les études de Wundt et les expériences de Fechner démontrent que la continuité vécue peut être appréhendée par des mesures quantitatives, sans annihiler son caractère qualitatif.

The Kantian account holds that memory is not a mere flux of lived duration but the result of the transcendental synthesis of successive representations under the a priori form of inner time; thus past intuitions are retained as determinate representations, not as an indivisible qualitative flow.
