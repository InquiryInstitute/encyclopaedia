== Thank You for Reading

You have finished Volume I: Mind.

You've thought about attention, consciousness, memory, dreams, and many other topics. You've met writers from different times and places, each with their own way of understanding the mind.

== Questions to Carry With You

Here are some questions from this volume that you might keep thinking about:

* What do you notice your attention doing right now?
* Where do your thoughts come from?
* What makes a memory feel real?
* Do animals have minds like yours?
* Could a machine ever think?
* What do you know for certain?

You don't need to answer these questions today. They're the kind of questions that stay interesting your whole life.

== Words You Might Want to Remember

A list of important words from this volume:

* *Attention* — When your mind focuses on one thing instead of others
* *Consciousness* — The feeling of being aware, of experiencing anything at all
* *Memory* — How the past stays with us in the present
* *Imagination* — The power to picture things that aren't here
* *Will* — The feeling of wanting and choosing

== What Comes Next

Volume II is called *Language & Meaning*. It asks questions like:

* How do words mean things?
* Why do we need language to think?
* Can you translate perfectly from one language to another?
