.**Active‑instrumental cognition**  
When a child first attempts to ride a bicycle, the organism‑subject does not rely on a pre‑existing “mind‑box” that stores facts.  The rider’s bodily movements, visual perception of the road, and the emergent sense of balance constitute an **instrumental act**: thought is directed toward the modification of the environment (Dewey, *Experience and Nature*, 1934, § 30).  The rider feels the seat, senses the pedals turning, and, through a coordinated series of adjustments, steers the bicycle.  The activity itself is the primary datum of cognition; the subject learns by acting upon the world and by continuously re‑organizing the experience in service of the goal of staying upright.

**Continuity and interaction**  
Dewey’s doctrine of *continuity of experience* is more than a linear memory chain.  It is the qualitative integration of past and present that yields a **unified stream** in which each moment is both a result of previous interaction and a condition for future growth (Dewey, *Experience and Education*, 1938, p. 45).  The familiar episode of learning to tie a shoe illustrates this: the child watches an adult, attempts the knot, and the present attempt is linked to the earlier observation not merely by chronological succession but by a **growth of the organism** that reshapes the habit of hand‑eye coordination.

**Inquiry as dialogue**  
In a classroom experiment—“What will happen if we mix water and sand?”—the subject first observes the physical change, then formulates a tentative prediction, and finally tests a new mixture.  The resulting cycle of **action‑reflection‑action** exemplifies Dewey’s view of inquiry as a **transactional dialogue** between the organism and its environment (Dewey, *Democracy and Education*, 1916, ch. III).  Crucially, the reflective stage is not a passive recording of results; it is a **deliberative, systematic thought** that can revise or abandon the underlying habit (see Dewey, *Logic: The Theory of Inquiry*, 1938, § 2.1).

**Habit formation and reflective modification**  
Repeated practice, such as daily piano scales, leads to the formation of a habit: a stable, recurrent way of acting that emerges from past experience (Dewey, *Experience and Nature*, 1934, § 42).  The habit becomes increasingly automatic, yet Dewey stresses its **flexibility**: reflective inquiry can reorganize the habit when the musical context changes.  This distinguishes mere habituation from the higher‑order **reflective thought** capable of purposeful modification.

**Social and democratic dimension**  
For Dewey, cognition is never an isolated individual process.  Language, culture, and communal interaction constitute the **community of inquiry** that shapes and is shaped by habit formation (Dewey, *The School and Society*, 1900).  Educational problems must therefore be rooted in the lived experience of children—issues of municipal sanitation, local commerce, or neighborhood safety—so that inquiry prepares citizens for participatory democracy (Dewey, *Democracy and Education*, 1916, ch. II).  The social nature of experience underwrites the transactional view of mind‑body; Dewey rejects Cartesian dualism in favor of a **transactionalism** that treats organism and environment as inseparable parts of a single process (Dewey, *Experience and Nature*, 1934, § 1).

**Empirical grounding and comparative perspective**  
Dewey’s pragmatism draws on contemporary experimental psychology, notably the work of William James on the “stream of consciousness” and the psychophysical studies of Wilhelm Wundt.  While James emphasizes the fluidity of experience, Dewey foregrounds its **instrumental function** in problem solving.  Compared with Piaget’s stage theory, Dewey’s account is less hierarchical and more attuned to the continual re‑organization of habit through reflective inquiry.

**Limitations and later developments**  
Critics have argued that Dewey under‑emphasizes affective and unconscious processes, a point later addressed by psycho‑social theorists such as Erik Erikson and contemporary embodied cognition scholars.  Nevertheless, Dewey’s insistence on the **active, habit‑forming, socially embedded organism** remains a foundational contribution to educational philosophy and cognitive theory.

Der Dewey‑Ansatz verkennt, dass das „instrumentale“ Handeln nicht allein aus bewusster Zweckorientierung entspringt, sondern aus latenten Trieben, deren Energie (Libido) das motorische System mobilisiert; die scheinbare Kontinuität beruht also ebenso auf unbewusster Spannungsreduktion wie auf sensorischer Anpassung.

Although Dewey rightly stresses motoric engagement, his account omits the indispensable function of internal symbolic mediation; cognition cannot be reduced to mere environmental adjustment, for the mind must retain and manipulate abstract representations that persist beyond immediate sensorimotor loops.
