[CANONICAL TEXT TO BE GENERATED]

When you pay attention, your mind chooses one thing and lets other things fade.
You can notice this happening.

Try listening to two sounds at once. One becomes clear, and the other slips away.
This does not mean the other sound is gone. It means your mind is not holding it.

Some people think attention is a kind of strength.
Others think it is more like a limit: you can only hold so much at one time.

What do you notice your attention doing right now?

A "limit" can still be useful. A lantern shines by not lighting everything.
