.**Awareness (Bewusstheit)**  

---  

### 1.  Basic phenomenology of awareness  

In the phenomenological description consciousness is always *intentional*: every act of awareness is a directedness toward an object. The intentional structure is analysable into the *noesis* (the act‑moment, the “how” of the consciousness) and the *noema* (the object as it is intended, the “what”). The transcendental ego, by a synthetic act, constitutes the field of experience in which noesis and noema are united. ( *Ideas I* §2‑3 ).  

The methodological starting‑point is the *epoché*—the phenomenological reduction whereby the natural attitude is bracketted, so that the pure phenomenon may be described without presupposing causal or empirical explanations. (*Logical Investigations* §190‑200).

### 2.  Non‑reflective (pre‑reflective) awareness  

Consider the warm cup held in one’s hands. The *noesis* is the feeling of heat, the smoothness of the ceramic, the rising steam; the *noema* is the cup‑as‑intended, together with its attendant “scene.” This awareness is already temporal: the present perception is supplied by *retention* of the just‑past steam and by *protention* of the expected warmth that will continue. No “mental organization” in the sense of a post‑hoc representation is required; the field of experience is constituted in the act itself.  

---  

### 3.  Reflective self‑awareness  

When one asks, “What am I feeling now?” a second‑order act is performed. The first act remains the primary feeling; the second act, a *self‑presentation* of the first, is made possible by a fresh epoché that suspends the natural‑attitude toward the feeling and lets it appear in its pure qualitative shape. This reflective turn does not double the feeling but clarifies its *eidetic* structure—its essential character—without altering its essence.

### 4.  Temporal structure and the lived body  

The body is not a mere physiological machine that “signals change.” Husserl speaks of the *Leib*—the lived body—as the medium through which the world is disclosed. Bodily affectivity (the quickening of the heart, the breath that uncovers a faint odor) belongs to the *noetic* side of intentionality: the lived body is the horizon that makes the perception possible. The temporal synthesis of retention, primal impression, and protention gives the “whole scene” its continuity.  

---  

### 5.  Intersubjective and cultural dimensions  

Awareness is never isolated from the *Lebenswelt* (lifeworld). In *Cartesian Meditations* §4 Husserl shows how the transcendental ego, through *transcendental intersubjectivity*, constitutes a shared horizon of meaning. The “crowd’s excitement” at a concert, therefore, is not a mere aggregate of individual noises; it is a *shared intentionality* in which each subject’s noesis is coordinated with a common noema of the concert event. This shared field can both enrich and conceal individual nuances, calling for a disciplined attention that discerns the particular within the communal.

### 6.  Language, signification, and the moral weight of attention  

Language functions as a *symbolic medium* that can disclose or veil meaning. Naming a vague tension as “anxiety” is a phenomenological clarification: the act of signification makes the qualitative aspect explicit without destroying its essence. Yet, as Husserl notes in the *Logical Investigations*, signifiers also frame the experience, thereby influencing the way the ego will attend to it. True attention, therefore, carries a moral charge: to give “gravity” (Schwere) to what is shown to us is an act of love‑oriented responsibility, a disciplined turning toward truth that shapes our ethical relation to self, others, and the world.

### 7.  Developmental and pedagogical notes  

The suggestion to practice “noticing three details of any scene” is a useful exercise for training the phenomenological attitude. While Husserl himself does not treat childhood acquisition of intentionality, contemporary phenomenologists (e.g., Gallagher, Zahavi) have shown that such disciplined observation can foster the capacity for *eidetic* variation and for the reflective turn described above. The pedagogical aim is not merely description but the opening of the “why” question, which leads the learner from the given of perception to the *transcendental* horizon that makes perception possible.  

---  

### 8.  Epistemological significance  

Awareness supplies the *meaningful givenness* upon which scientific theorizing can later build. The microscope reveals cells; the phenomenological reduction renders the appearance of the cells intelligible, thereby furnishing the horizon within which biology may formulate its laws. This grounding is not a naïve empiricism; it rests on the constitutive activity of the transcendental ego, which supplies the horizon of meaning that makes any data *significant*.

Through these clarifications the entry retains its accessible illustrations while aligning its terminology and structure with Husserl’s own phenomenological method.

While Husserl’s noesis–noema schema elegantly parses the structure of experience, it presupposes a pre‑theoretical “transcendental ego” that lacks empirical grounding. A naturalistic account should explain awareness in terms of brain‑generated representations and the intentional stance, without invoking synthetic acts of constitution.

note.The phenomenologist forgets that awareness is first and foremost an opening toward the absolute, a gravity that precedes intentionality; it is not a mental act but a surrender, a force that draws the soul toward truth.
