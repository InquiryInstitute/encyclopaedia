.**Collective Conscience (Conscience Collective)**  

---

### 1. Historical Emergence  

The notion of a *conscience collective* first appears in Émile Durkheim’s early sociological works, notably in **_De la division du travail social_** (1893) and **_Les règles de la méthode sociologique_** (1895). Confronted with the disintegration of mechanical solidarity in modern societies, Durkheim sought a sui generis social reality capable of regulating moral conduct when the bond of shared belief no longer rests on simple resemblance. The term therefore designates the set of moral beliefs and sentiments that exist **outside** the individual mind, yet exert a coercive influence upon it.  

> “La conscience collective est une réalité qui n’est pas la simple somme des consciences individuelles; elle possède une existence propre, sui generis.”  
> — *Les règles de la méthode sociologique*, § 2  

Durkheim’s formulation departs from the positivist individualism of his predecessors, insisting that social facts are *things* (faits sociaux) that must be studied with the same rigor as natural phenomena.

### 2. Definition and Theoretical Framework  

#### 2.1. The Concept  

A *conscience collective* is the totality of **norms, values, and representations** that a society shares and that are internalised by its members through socialisation. It is **external** to any single individual (it exists prior to and independently of any one mind) and **coercive** (it constrains behaviour by imposing a moral authority).  

#### 2.2. Relation to Solidarity  

- **Mechanical Solidarity** – In societies of the type of the “savage” (as examined in *Les formes élémentaires de la vie religieuse*), the collective conscience is **homogeneous**; it reproduces the same beliefs throughout the community, binding individuals together through similarity.  
- **Organic Solidarity** – In modern, differentiated societies, the collective conscience becomes **heterogeneous**; it no longer consists of identical beliefs but of a set of **normative regulations** that coordinate the interdependence of specialised functions. The collective conscience thus transforms from a **repressive** force into a **regulative** one, ensuring the cohesion of an organic whole.  

#### 2.3. Methodological Criteria  

Durkheim proposes three tests for any social fact, including the collective conscience:  

1. **Externality** – The phenomenon must exist outside the individual, observable as an objective constraint (e.g., legal codes, religious rites).  
2. **Generality** – It must be common to the majority of members of the society.  
3. **Necessity** – It must be indispensable for the maintenance of social order.  

*Example*: The French civil religion of the Third Republic (the daily “laïc” prayer, the celebration of the Republic’s founding) illustrates a collective conscience that is external (state‑mandated ceremonies), general (participated in by the majority of citizens), and necessary (providing a shared moral horizon in a secularising nation).

### 3. Empirical Illustrations  

#### 3.1. Religious Totemism  

In his study of Australian aboriginal totemic societies, Durkheim showed how the **totem** functions as a symbolic representation of the collective conscience. The totemic rites reinforce the belief that the clan’s moral order is embodied in the totemic object, thereby internalising the social norm through collective effervescence.  

#### 3.2. French Civil Religion  

The secular rituals of the French Republic (the national anthem, the oath to the Republic, the celebration of Bastille Day) act as modern equivalents of totemic ceremonies. They transmit a set of civic values—liberty, equality, fraternity—that constitute the contemporary collective conscience.

### 4. Limits and Internal Tensions  

Durkheim never claimed that the collective conscience is a monolithic “mind” that dictates each thought. Rather, it is a **set of shared representations** that arise from the **interactions** of individuals within institutions (family, school, church, law). The conscience thus **coexists** with individual autonomy: the individual internalises the collective norms, yet retains the capacity for moral judgement and innovation.

### 5. Critical Reception and Later Developments  

| School | Main Critique / Development |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| **Marxist** | Argues that the collective conscience masks underlying class relations and serves the interests of the dominant class, thereby reifying ideology. |
| **Phenomenological** (e.g., Husserl, Schutz) | Warns against treating the conscience as a “thing” that can be measured, emphasizing instead the lived experience of meaning. |
| **Anthropological** (Mauss) | Extends the concept to the **total social fact**, showing how gift exchange embodies collective moral obligations. |
| **Sociological Structuralism** (Giddens) | Re‑interprets the conscience as a **structuring structure**, a set of rules and resources that both enable and constrain agency. |
| **Contemporary Cognitive Science** | Uses “collective mind” to denote distributed cognition in networks; however, this differs fundamentally from Durkheim’s moral‑regulatory focus. |

### 6. Areas for Further Exploration  

- **Mechanisms of Transmission** – Education, ritual, and law act as the principal vectors through which the collective conscience is inculcated. A detailed analysis of schooling curricula in the Third Republic, for instance, reveals how moral norms become internalised from childhood.  
- **Quantitative Approaches** – Recent attempts to operationalise the collective conscience (e.g., survey indices of social solidarity) must grapple with Durkheim’s insistence on the *qualitative* nature of moral facts; any numerical indicator can only approximate the underlying normative force.  
- **Multicultural Contexts** – In societies where multiple collective consciences coexist, the interaction between them raises questions about the limits of Durkheim’s original model, inviting extensions that consider overlapping normative frameworks.

marginal note.The term “collective conscience” must not be confused with the a‑priori moral law that, in pure practical reason, is common to all rational agents; it denotes merely a contingent, empirical aggregation of sentiments, whose coercion lacks the universality and necessity of the categorical imperative.

.Durkheim’s collective conscience may be viewed as the externalisation of the group’s shared unconscious, wherein repressed libidinal and aggressive instincts are symbolically codified; thus the “mind” of the crowd reflects not a separate entity but a projection of the individual’s unconscious structures.
